# Facial-Detection

This is a Java Program that a friend and I made to be able to recognize faces in real time basis.

Here is the link to the video in which we demo our program.

Powerpoint of the project is also available.

RealTime2 and Detection2 are the two primary files in which we used for the app. I do not know if they are the right ones as the main source code and demo was done under my friends laptop, however, it should be about right.
